Description: Secure Sockets Layer toolkit - cryptographic utility
 This package is part of the OpenSSL project's implementation of the SSL
 and TLS cryptographic protocols for secure communication over the
 Internet.
 .
 It contains the general-purpose command line binary /usr/bin/openssl,
 useful for cryptographic operations such as:
  * creating RSA, DH, and DSA key parameters;
  * creating X.509 certificates, CSRs, and CRLs;
  * calculating message digests;
  * encrypting and decrypting with ciphers;
  * testing SSL/TLS clients and servers;
  * handling S/MIME signed or encrypted mail.

Description: Secure Sockets Layer toolkit - cryptographic utility
 This package is part of the OpenSSL project's implementation of the SSL
 and TLS cryptographic protocols for secure communication over the
 Internet.
 .
 This package contains the legacy provider. The OpenSSL legacy provider
 supplies OpenSSL implementations of algorithms that have been deemed legacy.
 Such algorithms have commonly fallen out of use, have been deemed insecure by
 the cryptography community, or something similar.
 For details see OSSL_PROVIDER-legacy man page.

 This package contains the FIPS provider. The OpenSSL FIPS provider is a
 special provider that conforms to the Federal Information Processing Standards
 (FIPS) specified in FIPS 140-2. This 'module' contains an approved set of
 cryptographic algorithms that is validated by an accredited testing
 laboratory.
 For details see OSSL_PROVIDER-fips and fips_module man page.
